The project aims to lay the foundations for the construction of the Urban Archaeological Park of the City of Naples by defining its initial location in the archaeological site of Piazza Municipio. From a conceptual point of view, NAPLES URBAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PARK is based on the assumption that without knowledge there is no lasting enhancement and without protection there is no heritage to be passed on to future generations. One of the main objectives is, therefore, to satisfy the need for information and services relating to cultural heritage through methods that favor the innovation of protection and enhancement systems. In this sense, each of the project objectives intends to create an interaction of skills and knowledge, creating a synergistic solution to the various needs of the region's cultural sector. In summary, the various skills applied to BBCCs are structured in a system that integrates the main functions for the virtuous management of Cultural Heritage. The pivot of the intervention is the growth and dissemination of Knowledge declined as an analysis to domain specialists, as a useful diagnostic for safeguarding and disseminating it to the wider public.
