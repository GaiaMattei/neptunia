The Computational Intelligence and Smart Systems Lab (CI&SSLab) is a research laboratory of the Department of Science and Technology at the University of Naples “Parthenope”.
Main activities are involved in fundamental and applied researches in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, in particular, in Computational Intelligence (CI).
CI is the theory, design, application, and development of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms.

* **_Soft Computing_**
CI&SSLab is interested in exploiting the aspects of intolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, approximate reasoning, and partial truth in order to achieve tractability, robustness, and low-cost solutions for handling real-life ambiguous situations by CI-based approaches.

* **_Computational Biology_**
The aim of Computational Biology (CB) is to understand the mechanistic basis of human disease, using a combination of computational and experimental techniques.
At CI&SSLab researches involved in many aspects of CB and bioinformatics, using biological data to develop algorithms or models to understand biological systems and relationships.

* **_Internet of Everything_**
In this context, the scope is bringing together people, processes, data, and things for creating new capabilities and richer experiences.

* **_Natural Language Processing_**
CI&SSLab is interested in how to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data, in particular for Knowledge Management of Web and Social Information.

* **_Human-Computer Interaction_**
Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers. CI&SSLab researchers are interested in applying CI-based methodologies for Brain-Computer Interface.

* **_CI for Security System Networking_**
CI&SSLab is interested in how Security Systems are applied for Networking.
