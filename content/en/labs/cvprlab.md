The Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition group is part of the Department of Science and Technology at the University of Naples “Parthenope”. The research envisaged covers a broad spectrum of issues related to Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Image Processing, and participates in a variety of applied projects, where results and know-how from those programs are exploited.

* **_Computer Vision_**
The research is naturally focused on image analysis and understanding aspects in the large, which are at the basis of all advanced processing. Specific on multiresolution, object recognition, soft computing in image analysis, attentive vision mechanisms with applications to video surveillance, medical imaging, multimedia data treatment.

* **_Pattern Recognition_ **
Research in this field is mainly focused on the probabilistic models for pattern recognition, because of their interesting theoretical properties and their wide applicability in (not only) computer vision tasks.
Our interest is mainly in investigating Neural Networks, Markov Random Fields, and Kernel Methods.
We are interested both in methodological, e.g. learning and model selection, and applicative issues, as shape classification, event detection, and classification and clustering, tracking, and video surveillance.
Our research is also oriented on very promising non-probabilistic techniques, like Support Vector Machines.
